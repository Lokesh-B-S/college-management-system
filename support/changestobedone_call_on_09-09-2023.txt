if clg admin or hod etc logs in, based on that the courses to be displayed in timetable selection.

already a subject is present should appear if more than one preexisting course is selected.(check if anything like addifabsent is available in crudrepo)

program specific timeslots to be appeared on timetable.
(for that need to create master table, where for example 9-10,10-11....belongs to branch id 001, 7-8,8-9..so belongs to branch id 002,
only that particular timeslots has to be appeared in th of timetable view)



sem select, faculty select, time - attendance
should display the list of students for that course, condition that if student not opted that course should show NA instead of present or absent







student can opt out a subject, if so another table to be created to
studentwise per semester i should know how many subjects i should display
student id, course id, sem id (to be collected for which subj i am not opting)
not opted details should be by admin to mark the student as not opted for that subject in sepearte table





Note: commit always for dml statements in mysql



//works done

resolved issue with passing id from selectTimeTable to editTimeTable
listTT to display based on the branchsemsec, instead of a constant one
created Program
added timeSlot Selection :- to add the timeslots manually
also displayed only particular branch related timeslots in dropdown
made timetable output to show only particular branch related timeslots instead of all
added program and branch columns(dropdowns) in course table - DONE
show the particular branch related courses dropdown in editTimetable page - DONE
branch table had course field which was unnecessary and replaced by program
associated course with faculty in a new table and also view them
displayed faculty along with course in timetable output
(for that hint is check courses in editTimetable, it is coming based on only branch which is worng,it should be based on semester too.
display all those that appear in courses in editTT in listTT to avoid repeats)
alert
only single course adding in editTT (else alert the user that if you want to add this entry delete the previous entry)
added delete button and also with alerts too

multiple courses avoided in timetable completely (unique)
faculty shortname in table as well as below table(one extra column)





//things to do now

branch rename as department - DONE
department -> divisions -> program, others ->

course -> Add/select batch -> semester & academic year -> courses
batch example: 1NH19, 1NH15,...    - DONE

timetable -> department/ program/ semester/ batch/ section/ (inside)
note;- (display above details in editTimeTable)





trying to change the navbar dropdown (custom.js technique is not working)
if we delete faculty in viewfaculty which is in use in other page say timetable it shows error for deleting. Avoid it



show edit and delete for the course added to TT (hint give links instead of text format for courses in TT for admin login atleast)



 <th th:if="${entry.course.courseCode != #vars.prevCode}" th:text="${entry.course.courseCode}"></th>
        <th th:if="${entry.course.courseName != #vars.prevName}" th:text="${entry.course.courseName}"></th>

        <!-- Update #vars.prevCode and #vars.prevName for the next iteration -->
        <th:block th:with="#vars.prevCode=${entry.course.courseCode}, #vars.prevName=${entry.course.courseName}"></th:block>





----
safer side codes:

//below line is for only course display-->
<div style="text-align:center" th:if="${entry?.day?.name == day.name && entry?.timeSlot?.startTime == timeSlot?.startTime}" th:text="${entry?.course?.courseCode}">-->
---

//course and faculty names in timetable cells to an extent:
<div style="text-align:center" th:if="${entry?.day?.name == day.name && entry?.timeSlot?.startTime == timeSlot?.startTime}">
                        <div th:each="allotment : ${allotments}" th:if="${entry?.course?.courseName == allotment?.course?.courseName}">
                            <span th:text="${entry?.course?.courseCode} + ' - (' + ${allotment?.faculty?.shortName} + ')'"></span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
